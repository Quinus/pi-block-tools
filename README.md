# pi-block-tools

Block-styled Claude Code inspired tool rendering for Pi — Shiki-powered diffs, status dots, branch connectors, file icons, and configurable output modes.

## Features

- **Compact built-in tool rendering** for `read`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `edit`, and `write`
- **Claude-style OpenAI tool rendering** for `apply_patch` plus common Pi/OpenAI-style tools like `webfetch`, `web_search`, `fetch_content`, task tools, and context tools
- **`apply_patch` diff previews** that render parsed file patches in the call phase, similar to `edit`/`write`
- **Adaptive edit/write diffs** with split or unified layouts, syntax highlighting, and inline word-level emphasis
- **Diff stat bar** with colored add/remove summary and hunk metadata
- **Progressive collapsed diff hints** that shorten on narrow terminals
- **Thinking labels** during streaming and final messages, with context sanitization
- **MCP-aware rendering** with hidden, summary, and preview modes
- **Configurable output modes** for read, search, bash, and MCP results
- **Live running previews** that show a few output lines for active tool calls (latest lines for bash), persisting until the next tool/text activity
- **Subagent completion notifications** restyled to match the same Claude-style tool rows
- **RTK rewrite integration** that folds rewrite notices into the bash tool row with a muted `(RTK)` badge and expanded-only rewrite details
- **Transparent tool backgrounds** in `transparent` mode
- **pi-block-style palette** — branch connectors, user prompts, spinner text, and diff accents use the same Atom One Dark colors as `pi-block-style`
- **Theme-adaptive palette** — branch connectors, dim text, spinner accent, and diff backgrounds can still follow the active pi theme (set `themeAdaptive: false` to keep the fixed block-style palette)
- **Transparent edit/write diffs** with Atom One Dark green/red diff colors
- **Global transparent chrome patch** for all tool rows, including unknown/custom tools

## Configuration

Set in `.pi/settings.json` or `~/.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "toolBackground": "transparent",
  "readOutputMode": "preview",
  "searchOutputMode": "preview",
  "mcpOutputMode": "preview",
  "previewLines": 8,
  "bashOutputMode": "opencode",
  "bashCollapsedLines": 10,
  "liveToolPreview": true,
  "liveToolPreviewLines": 5,
  "diffCollapsedLines": 24,
  "themeAdaptive": false,
  "diffTheme": "github-dark"
}
```

### Theme integration

By default, `pi-block-tools` uses the fixed `pi-block-style` Atom One Dark palette. When `themeAdaptive` is `true`, the following colors are derived from the active pi theme on every render and re-derived whenever the theme changes:

| Element | Derived from |
|---------|--------------|
| Branch connectors (`├─`, `└─`, `│`) | `dim` (fallback: `muted`) |
| "✻ Worked for Ns" line | `muted` |
| Thinking-block italic gray | `muted` |
| Diff add/remove accents | `toolDiffAdded` / `toolDiffRemoved` |
| Diff background tints | mixed against `toolSuccessBg` base |
| Spinner verb text (`Working…`) | `borderAccent` (fallback: `accent`) |
| Spinner status text | `muted` |

User-supplied `diffTheme` presets and `diffColors` overrides always win over theme-derived defaults. File-type icons (e.g. `ts`, `py`, `rs`) keep their language-identity colors and are not theme-derived.

Set `themeAdaptive: false` to keep the fixed `pi-block-style` Atom One Dark palette regardless of the active pi theme.

#### Toggle at runtime with `/cc-theme`

```text
/cc-theme           # show current setting + theme name
/cc-theme status    # show current setting + color preview (incl. spinner)
/cc-theme on        # follow pi theme
/cc-theme off       # keep fixed Claude palette
/cc-theme toggle    # flip the current value
```

The selection is persisted to `~/.pi/settings.json` and applied to the next rendered tool row. No restart required.

#### Repaint the spinner with `/cc-spinner`

The spinner glyph itself is still colored by pi's loader using `accent`, while the verb text (e.g. `Cooking…`) follows `accent` by default to match `pi-block-style` blue. The status suffix (e.g. `(thinking · ↓ 10 tokens · 2s)`) follows `muted`. Use `/cc-spinner` to bind either text element to any other theme color key:

```text
/cc-spinner preview          # list every common theme key with a colored sample
/cc-spinner verb <key>       # change the verb color (e.g. thinkingHigh, mdHeading)
/cc-spinner status <key>     # change the status suffix color
/cc-spinner reset            # restore defaults (verb=accent, status=muted)
```

The selection is persisted as `spinnerVerbColor` / `spinnerStatusColor` in `~/.pi/settings.json` and applied on the next spinner tick.

### Tool background modes

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `default` | Standard Pi tool backgrounds |
| `transparent` | Transparent tool backgrounds |
| `border` / `outlines` | Legacy aliases for `transparent` |

### Output modes

| Setting | Values | Default |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `readOutputMode` | `hidden`, `summary`, `preview` | `preview` |
| `searchOutputMode` | `hidden`, `count`, `preview` | `preview` |
| `mcpOutputMode` | `hidden`, `summary`, `preview` | `preview` |
| `bashOutputMode` | `opencode`, `summary`, `preview` | `opencode` |

### Search tool registration

By default, this extension registers Pi-compatible `grep` and `find` tools unless `pi-fff` is configured with `fff-mode=override` or `PI_FFF_MODE=override`. In that mode, `pi-fff` owns the global `grep` / `find` tool names and this extension skips those registrations to avoid extension conflicts.

Set `registerSearchTools` in `.pi/settings.json` or `~/.pi/settings.json` when you need to force the behavior:

```json
{
  "registerSearchTools": false
}
```

Use `false` when another extension provides `grep` / `find`. Use `true` only when you explicitly want this extension to register those tools.

### Numeric settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `previewLines` | `8` | Lines shown in collapsed preview mode |
| `expandedPreviewMaxLines` | `4000` | Max lines when fully expanded |
| `bashCollapsedLines` | `10` | Lines for collapsed bash output |
| `liveToolPreview` | `true` | Show a small live output preview while tools are still running |
| `liveToolPreviewLines` | `5` | Lines shown in the collapsed live preview |
| `diffCollapsedLines` | `24` | Diff lines before collapsing |

## Notes

This package targets recent Pi versions where tool renderers use:

- `renderCall(args, theme, context)`
- `renderResult(result, { expanded, isPartial }, theme, context)`

Unknown/custom tools do not have a public global renderer hook in Pi, so this package patches container rendering to keep custom tool rows visually consistent with the built-in transparent rendering.
